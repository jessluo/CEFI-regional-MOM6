# Multi-year single-column run under repeat-year forcing.
#
#   usage: ./run_multiyear.sh <n_years> [executable]
#   e.g.   ./run_multiyear.sh 10
#          ./run_multiyear.sh 2 ../../builds/build/mac-m1-osx-gnu/ocean_ice/repro/MOM6SIS2
#
# The JRA55-do forcing in this experiment covers calendar year 2004 only, so a
# multi-year integration re-runs that same year repeatedly. Each segment reads
# the ocean / sea-ice / BGC state left by the previous one but resets the model
# clock back to 2004-01-01, so the forcing always lines up. This is standard
# repeat-year forcing (RYF): the ocean spins up, the atmosphere does not vary
# between years.
#
# The clock reset is done with force_date_from_namelist = .true. in
# input.nml_1yr_rst, which overrides the date in INPUT/coupler.res while still
# using the restart fields. Segment 1 is a cold start (input.nml_1yr).
#
# Because every segment carries the same model dates, output files from
# different segments would otherwise overwrite each other. Each segment's
# history and restarts are therefore moved into history/yearNN/ and
# RESTART_yearNN/ when it finishes.
#
# Run ./setup_station.sh first -- this script does not build the grid.
